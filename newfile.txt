This is a test
And again
Maybe third time is a charm?
Or perhaps the fourth?
The fifth time should yield victory
But yet we are here again
Gathering diagnostic data
Another try
Now I should have victory
When we use the right Python module it definitely helps
Finally?
This really is getting a bit long in the tooth
Helps when Github has our SSH key
Final victory?
Guess it was.
